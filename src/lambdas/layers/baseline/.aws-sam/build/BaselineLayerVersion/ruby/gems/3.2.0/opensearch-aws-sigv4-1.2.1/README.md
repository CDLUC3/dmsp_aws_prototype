# OpenSearch AWS Sigv4 Client

The `opensearch-aws-sigv4` library provides an AWS Sigv4 client for connecting to [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/index.html).

This library is an AWS Sigv4 wrapper for [`opensearch-ruby`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby/tree/main), which is a Ruby client for OpenSearch. The `OpenSearch::Aws::Sigv4Client`, therefore, has all features of `OpenSearch::Client`.

## Compatibility

The `opensearch-aws-sigv4` library is compatible with all versions of `opensearch-ruby`.
